        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> My name is Daniela, but I prefer to be called Dani! I am 21 years old and I am persuing my Masters in International Business. I decided to go back to school to finish my masters because I think it would give me the upper hand later in life for my career. Currently, I am a full time student and live at home with my parents in South Florida. I have 3 syblings and I am the second oldest. When I was in college completing my undergrad, I bought my dream puppy, his name is Bentley and he is a golden retriever. I am very hard working, funny, and motivated! I pride myself in my work ethic and put my mind to anything I want to accomplish! </a>
